# XBox One Directory Traversal and Information Exposure
# Xbox One OS Version 10.0.18363.8119 (19h1_release_xbox_dev_1911.191119-1135) has Directory Traversal and Information Leakage vulnerabilities
## Note from 2023
This vulnerability was found late 2019 while working on some protocol vulnerabilities like CallStranger on my old XBox one. I've sent early report to Microsoft and went on a work trip. When I was back I saw File Explorer application was removed from XBox One https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/ebrrf1/working_alternatives_to_xbox_file_explorer/ https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1202357755140546560 and report was not accepted with an attached tag 'non-reproducable' . I stopped working on XBox One after this ridiculous reply by MS Security team.
